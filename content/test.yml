  ## He moved over to the window


  Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war. For several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, some of which he remembered vividly.


  Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed) but there was no way of shutting it off completely.


  He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagerness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the Party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.


  * Saxum sustinuit pugnatum medere temptamenta vellera mihi

  * Thalamoque lugubris qui loco croceum

  * Torque exploratis ornum intexuit gestamina est

  * Verbis meorum canes intraverat simul in quem

  * Cutis mirabile tandemque ut in dominis Abarin

  * Marmore deus orant
